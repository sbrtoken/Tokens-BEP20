# Tokens ERC-20
ERC-20 is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. ERC-20 defines a common list of rules for Ethereum tokens to follow within the larger Ethereum ecosystem, allowing developers to accurately predict interaction between tokens. These rules include how the tokens are transferred between addresses and how data within each token is accessed.

# SGB Tokens ERC-20
SGB Tokens ERC20 - are tokens of the Ethereum network, which follow a set of fundamentals for the creation of the Bitfrost SGB network and the exchange of business services, for greater compliance and compliance through the blockchain.

  <p>üëã Welcome to ethereum.org!</p>
</h1>

[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) is a primary online resource for the Ethereum community. The purpose of the site is to _‚ÄúBe the best portal to Ethereum for our growing global community"_ - read more about what this means [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/purpose.md).

[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution. If you‚Äôre interested in helping to improve [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org), start here. This contribution guide will help you get started.

<br>

### Ethereum.org‚Äôs design and content is guided by three core principles:

**üåè 1. Ethereum.org is a portal to resources created by the community**

- It will never be ‚Äúencyclopedia ethereum‚Äù - we can‚Äôt add every link, or cover every topic
- Rather, its purpose is to direct people to community-built resources
- Ethereum.org trends toward minimal native-content

**üõ† 2. Ethereum.org is a work in progress, because Ethereum is a work in progress**

- It will change over time, as Ethereum evolves and the community evolves with it
- To accommodate long-term changes, the site has a simple design system & modular structure
- Changes to the site are iterative, as we learn more about how people use it and what the community wants from it
- Changes can be proposed by anyone, and we aim to cultivate a community of open-source contributors

**ü¶Ñ 3. Ethereum.org is not a typical product website**

- Ethereum is multifaceted. It's a project, a platform, a product, a vision of the future, a set of ideologies, a community, and much more.
- The site won't look like every other product site, because Ethereum isn't like every other product.

## How can I contribute?

## Translation Program

Ethereum is a global project, and it is critical that Ethereum.org is accessible to everyone, regardless of their nationality or language. Our community has been working hard to make this vision a reality. We're constantly working to add additional language support & to keep our existing translations up to date. You can [view the progress of all our translations here](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation).

Looking to get involved as a translator? Here's how:

1. Follow [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/invite) to join our project on CrowdIn.
2. You will need to create a CrowdIn account if you don't have one. Here's [documentation on how to use CrowdIn](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/).
3. Find the language you want to participate in. If it's below 100%, please contribute! Don't see your langugae? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose).

Once translation is completed (i.e. all files display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete, we will add it to the website.

Thank you for your particpation in the language program!

## Notes on individual sub-pages:

If you want to suggest changes to particular sub-pages, keep in mind the purpose of each page:

### üõ† Developers

- The purpose of this page is to collect core technical resources helpful to someone building on Ethereum
- Information should be kept as up to date as possible, as new tools appear, standards are adopted, or material is deprecated
- This page will never be completely comprehensive: the goal is to list the most popular or widely used resources or tools.

Developer tool submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

- Is it meaningfully differentiated from tools already listed?
  - New categories or types of tools
  - New features compared to existing similar tools
  - Targeted at a distinct use-case not covered by existing similar tools
- Is the tool well documented?
  - Does documentation exist?
  - Is it sufficient to use the tool?
  - Has it been recently updated?
- Is the tool widely used?
  - We will consider metrics such as Github stars, download statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects.
- Is the tool of sufficient quality?
  - Are there recurring bugs?
  - Is the tool reliable?

### üìö Learn

- The purpose of this page is to collect educational material about Ethereum on a variety of topics
- Some information will be technical in nature, but it will also include non-technical information, or articles that may serve as inspiration to community members

### üì± Use

- This page is for the person who wants to get started using Ethereum, but doesn‚Äôt know how.
- This page will stay limited to 3 sections: Dapps, Ether, and Wallets.
- Useful contributions include: submitting suggestions for dapps to rotate onto this page, submitting suggestions for better links about Ether or Wallets.
- We will rotate the list of dapps on this page frequently!

Dapp submissions will be assessed on the following criteria:

- Is the dapp a "user" application? This page is targeted at the average user, which means it wouldn't be appropriate to list a dev tool or app targeted at sophisticated technical users.
- Does the application have a good user on-boarding process, such that a user can follow the link, and find all the instructions they need to get started?
- Does the application "round out" the list by adding a new kind of application not already present?
- Is there evidence that the application is popular and well established?

### üëã Beginners

- The purpose of this page is to offer a coherent answer to the most basic questions about Ethereum: what is it, and why does it exist?
- Because this page is very simple and does not contain much content, changes to the text will be limited.
- Useful contributions include: suggesting better ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù content to link at the bottom of the page, or suggesting images that could be added to the page to break up the text.

## ü§î How are decisions about the site made?

Decisions about individual PRs, design evolution, and major upgrades to the website are made by a team of people from across the Ethereum ecosystem. This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: raising questions in issues, submitting PRs, or contacting the team at website@ethereum.org is helpful!

This team currently includes:

- Anuj Gupta (Ethereum Foundation)
- Amanda Gutterman (ConsenSys)
- Hudson Jameson (Ethereum Foundation Devops)
- Taeyeon Kim (Ethereum Foundation)
- Jamie Pitts (Ethereum Foundation Devops)
- Sam Richards (Ethereum Foundation)
- Joseph Schweitzer (Ethereum Foundation)
- Josh Stark (L4, ETHGlobal, Ethereum Foundation)
- Charles St. Louis (MakerDAO & Ethereum Cat Herders)
- Evan Van Ness (ConsenSys & Ethereum Foundation)
- Alan Woo (Independent designer & developer)

- Confirm the Netlify preview deploy looks & functions as expected

### Review

- The [website team](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#-how-are-decisions-about-the-site-made) reviews every PR
- See [how decisions are made on content changes](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#notes-on-individual-sub-pages)
- Acceptable PRs will be approved & merged into the `dev` branch

### Deploy

- `master` is continually synced to Netlify and will automatically deploy new commits to etheruem.org
- The [website team](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#-how-are-decisions-about-the-site-made) will periodically merge `dev` into `master` (typically multiple times per week)

## Structure

Site content is in `/docs` folder. Everything else in `/docs/.vuepress`

## Test

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to create unit test for Vue components under `/docs/.vuepress/component` and `/dosc/.vuepress/theme/components`.

The unit tests are placed next to the Vue components under `/docs/.vuepress/component/__tests__` and `/dosc/.vuepress/theme/components/__tests__`. And module mocks are created under `/dosc/.vuepress/theme/utils/__mocks__` for @theme/utils module.

Below commands will be helpful when you develop or test the Vue components.

1. Run all the Jest unit tests,

```bash
yarn test
```

2. Run unit tests for the changed file,

```bash
yarn test -o
```

3. Update the snapshot if you're sure the old results are obselete,

```bash
yarn test --update-snapshot
```
